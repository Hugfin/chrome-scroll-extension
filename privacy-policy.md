# Privacy Policy for Chrome Scroll to Top Extension

Last Updated: December 19, 2023

## Overview
Chrome Scroll To Top Extension is a simple browser extension that adds a button to scroll to the top of web pages. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## Data Collection and Storage
This extension:
- Does not collect any personal information
- Does not track your browsing history
- Does not use cookies
- Does not transmit any data to external servers
- Only stores user preferences locally on your device using Chrome's storage API

## User Preferences
The only data stored by this extension is your personal preferences for the extension's functionality (such as button appearance settings). This data:
- Is stored locally on your device
- Is only accessible by the extension
- Can be cleared by uninstalling the extension
- Is never transmitted to external servers

## Permissions
This extension requires only one permission:
- "storage": Used only to save your preferences locally (such as your keyboard shortcut setting)

The extension uses content scripts to add the scroll-to-top button to web pages. Content scripts:
- Are automatically injected into web pages
- Only run on standard web pages (http:// and https:// URLs)
- Cannot access or modify browser settings
- Cannot access data from other websites

This minimal permission approach ensures maximum privacy and security for our users.
